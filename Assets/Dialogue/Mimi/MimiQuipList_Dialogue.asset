    MessageText: As Mimi takes a sip from the brew it is clear that the cooling sensation
      puts her busy mind the breathing room it needs, perhaps so much so that she
      forgets to take her second sip for a while.

    MessageText: Mimi takes her beverage and takes a sip with a minty aroma through
      Serenitea can be felt from the wistful sighs. She remains unresponsive to the
      minty taste, letting her mind simmer but takes a rather sharp inhale.

      form, perhaps fiercely so. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t include too much Breezeleaf."

    MessageText: Mimi sips from the mug only for her to be stunned by the warm sensations
      coursing through her form. She seems startled at first but calms after a couple
      more sips.

    MessageText: Mimi takes a sip from the tea and has a perch to her lips enjoying
      the sour tang although her features do eventually screw as the sourness curdles
      into certain parts of the tea.

      teeth there. It seems that the sweetness was a tad over the top for Mimi.

    MessageText: Mimi smacks whatever lips make up her ghostly mouth at the overly
      sweet sensation of the brew. Perhaps I'm using too much Ebonstraw.

    MessageText: Mimi seems to be enjoying the brew but there seems to be a rather
      dormant stare, as if her brain is switching off with each sip. That seems like
      a good thing right?

      Perhaps adding some Glow Limes to add a bit of zest would engage Mimi more.

      would do the trick.
