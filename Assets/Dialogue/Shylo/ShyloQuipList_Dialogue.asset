    MessageText: Shylo pauses for a moment with scrunched features after taking a
      sip from the tea. If his form had cheeks, they would be sucked between his
      hypothetical teeth.

    MessageText: Shylo takes a sip from the beverage which causes his eyes to lock
      tightly together for the briefest of moments as the sour tang hits his senses.

    MessageText: After taking a sip from the beverage Shylo shudders as the zesty
      tang surges through his form. Something briefly giggled about as he continued
      the rest of the beverage.

    MessageText: "Upon taking a sip Shylo shudders at the sour taste. It seems like
      Shylo prefers to not have a sour taste to his beverage at all. Perhaps he\u2019d
      prefer his brew without Glow Limes."

      wisps from his ethereal form as his senses clear.

    MessageText: A minty sigh emits from Shylo, a breeze so sharp it wooshes through
      the non-existent fabric on his spectral hoody.

      bottom lip and sucking the air through them. Maybe just a dash of Breezeleaf
      is more to Shylo\u2019s taste."

      though you cannot see it, you know it\u2019s there as the peacefulness to Shylo\u2019s
      motion when enjoying the brew slows his skittish movements."

    MessageText: The scent once again brings Shylo to a calming state and you almost
      start to feel that the scent of the brew is more satisfying than the taste.
      Maybe two dashes of Purple Crystal mixed with some other flavours would BREW
      Shylo away.

    MessageText: "The steam from the brew feels warmer as if the mixture had upped
      the temperature. Shylo\u2019s expression matches this warmth upon the first
      couple sips before returning to timid anxiousness."

    MessageText: As the warmth fills the room once more and Shylo retrieves the mug
      to drink from, there is a moment of coziness, abruptly closed by a breathy
      exhale from Shylo who tries to mask such with further sips.

      of calming warmth that is broken on occasion by the lofting of brows and the
      hollow sound of breath. Perhaps just a dash of Cinder Shard is more to Shylo\u2019s
      taste"
