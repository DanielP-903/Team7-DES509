    MessageText: Shylo pauses for a moment with scrunched features after taking a
      sip from the tea. If his form had cheeks, they would be sucked between his
      hypothetical teeth.

      Shylo prefers to not have a sour taste to his beverage at all. Perhaps he\u2019d
      prefer his brew without Glow Limes."

    MessageText: The scent once again brings Shylo to a calming state and you almost
      start to feel that the scent of the brew is more satisfying than the taste.
      Maybe just two dashes of Purple Crystal or Hearbud would BREW Shylo away.

      there would be a jump towards taking another sip as the aftertaste starts to
      settle in. It seems that Shylo isn\u2019t well adjusted to these sweet teas,
      perhaps keeping out Ebonstraw from the tea would be better for Shylo."

      by the blend although the sound of dry exhale would be quietly whistled throughout
      the room, making the temperature cooler than before. Did this breath come from
      Shylo? Perhaps counterbalancing the cool flavor would work.

      would chill the room once more. Perhaps the best way to counter the chilling
      flavors of the brew is with some Cindershard. That would maybe perfect this
      blend
